title: Site Network Graph
description: Interactive visualization of all pages and their relationships in this Docusaurus site
---

This page displays an interactive network graph representation of all markdown files in this Docusaurus site. The graph shows relationships between pages based on their directory structure and internal links.

import { NetworkGraphLoader } from '../components/NetworkGraph';

## Features

- **Interactive Nodes**: Double Click on any node to navigate to that page
  - Single Click to focus on that node and its related areas
- **Drag and Drop**: Drag nodes to explore the network structure
- **Zoom and Pan**: Use mouse wheel to zoom and drag to pan around the graph
- **Link Types**:
  - Solid lines show parent-child relationships (directory structure)
  - Dashed lines show reference relationships (markdown links between pages)

## Graph Statistics
## How It Works

The network graph plugin:

1. **Scans** all markdown files during the build process
2. **Extracts** metadata from frontmatter and content
3. **Analyzes** directory structure for parent-child relationships
4. **Parses** markdown links to find reference relationships
5. **Generates** an interactive D3.js force-directed graph
6. **Provides** click navigation and drag-and-drop interaction

This creates a visual map of your site's content structure and helps users understand how pages relate to each other.

The graph data is saved as `total-graph.json` and updated every time you build your site.
